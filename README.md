# Escape_The__Web_CAPSTONE

This is agame, made in the Unity game engine and using C# code. The game will be about the player going through different levels, 
based on different parts of the "dark web" as well as at least one level based on the normal, accessable internet. Level one, for example
is based on the "Silk Road", which is the part of the "Dark web" where people buy and sell all sorts of things, and I will include
references to entertaining stories I have found online about it. 

In this folder, there are all of the assets that I have created and imported into Unity, including, the sprites I have made, the animations
for those sprites, and the C# scripts for the start menu, player movement, and puzzles, for right now. I have used Microsoft Visual Studio
to write the code for the game, because that is the default for Unity developement.
